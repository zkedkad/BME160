    "# Overview\n",
    "This lab will give you practice with a real algorithm and with formatted output. We will be finding genes in a genome.\n",
    "\n",
    "An open reading frame (ORF) is a region of DNA that is free from stop codons (TAG, TAA, TGA). We can then define a putative gene in that ORF by the presence of a start codon at the 5' end of the ORF and a stop codon at the 3' end. Start codons in some bacteria, archaea and viruses can be ATG, GTG or CTG, and in some cases TTG.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Since genes are made up of codons of three symbols, any particular sequence of DNA can be interpreted in each of 3 overlapping coding frames, and since cellular genomic DNA is double stranded, we can have genes located on both strands, yielding 6 possible coding frames for the many genes in a genome.  Genes can also overlap each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "To limit the number of possible genes that we might find, two basic strategies are sometimes used:\n",
    "\n",
    " - look for genes that are longer than some predefined number (100 bases for example) and\n",
    " - only consider the largest coding region within an ORF, rather than considering all substrings in the ORF that begin with intermediate start codons.\n",
    " \n",
    "A well known ORF finder is available at NCBI - ORF Finder https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/orffinder/\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will write an equivalent tool that provides the same function, though without the graphical display.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use your sequenceAnalysis module in designing a solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your design is essential for success.  Spend time considering how best to solve this problem.  Write out pseudocode that describes the core algorithm.  This pseudocode is required to be delivered in comments at the top of your code submission.  Please start early on this assignment, and consider the algorithm carefully.  \n",
    " - Start and stop codons must be in the same frame, \n",
    " - many possible Met codons (or other possible starts) may exist in an ORF, and \n",
    " - genes can have significant overlap.\n",
    " - In some cases, 2 or more ORFS can exist on opposite strands in the same coordinate space.\n",
    "\n",
    "A partial solution exists in the text using regular expressions (Model p 271).  This solution does not handle any of the extra-credit possibilities, and does not handle the required boundary conditions involving gene fragments. Feel free to look, though I did not find this approach helpful. It also uses regular expressions, which are both difficult to read and disallowed for this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your implementation should be designed to add capability to your sequenceAnalysis module. Please carefully consider where that capability belongs. You are required to make use of your sequenceAnalysis module for most of the code and for FastAreader. You might consider adding  a function to calculate reverse complement. You should also add an OrfFinder class to sequenceAnalysis. For this assignment, you are the designer of your toolbox - choose wisely. You might use this again in your final project.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ORF finder\n",
    "Create a program to analyze a FASTA-formatted file containing a sequence of DNA and find the ORFs (start and stop codons). Your program is called findORFs.py and it:\n",
    "\n",
    " - reads in FASTA-formatted sequence data from a file using STDIN\n",
    " - finds ORFs that are >= 100 nucleotides in length\n",
    " - writes formatted output data to a text file using STDOUT\n",
    " - if there are multiple FASTA-formatted sequences in the file, you need to perform Orf-finding on each of them independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Design specification\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input file\n",
    "Input data must make use of STDIN. This will allow commandLine execution using: \n",
    "- findOrfs.py < someInput.\n",
    "I will provide 2 test files for your use.  For debugging purposes, use lab5test.fa, which is provided in Canvas::files.  As your final test, use the tass2.fa genome. I have provided the output generated by my program for your comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output file\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your tass2 output to a file named: tass2ORFdata-ATG-100.txt using STDOUT.  This file should be generated with the following program features:\n",
    "\n",
    " - The minimum gene size to report is 100 nucleotides (including stop and start)\n",
    " - The only start codon to consider is ATG\n",
    " - The stop codons in DNA form are: TAA TGA TAG\n",
    " - Only the largest putative gene in an ORF is reported\n",
    " - The input file is tass2.fa\n",
    " \n",
    "I have provided the output generated using a minimum gene size of 300, which you can use for testing. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Gene finding\n",
    "\n",
    "Your  program should find genes in each of the six possible coding frames.  The genes that you find will begin with a start codon and end with a stop codon, with the exception of those gene-fragments that might be located on the ends of the sequence (see boundary conditions).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Boundary conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "You may find that an ORF exists at either or both termini of the sequence you are examining.  This may mean that you will only be seeing a gene fragment located at the sequence termini. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the sequence:<br>\n",
    "AAA AAA AAA TGA CCC CCC ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we see a stop codon with a set of AAA codons located upstream.  In this case, assume that a start codon exists upstream of our sequence, and report this as a gene in Frame 1, starting at position 1, ending at position 12 and having a length of 12.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The same may occur on the 3' end of the sequence, for example: <br>\n",
    "A AAA AAA ATG CCC CCC CCC CC  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, report a gene in Frame 2 starting at position 8, ending at position 21 and having a length of 14.  \n",
    "\n",
    "And, of course genes can exist on the opposite strand, so: <br>\n",
    "TTA AAA AAA AAA CAT CC<br>\n",
    "would be reported in Frame -3, starting in position 1, ending at position 15, with length 15.\n",
    "\n",
    "NCBI ORF finder is a good test case to see what your output should look like.  THe NCBI program does not handle this boundary case however.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sort Order\n",
    "\n",
    "Your output should be sorted by decreasing ORF size, and in cases where multiple ORFs have the same size, sort those by the left position of the gene.  (build a key that makes this easy).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Minimum gene size (option)\n",
    "\n",
    "The minimum gene size to report is 100 nucleotides.  This count of nucleotides includes the start codon and stop codon.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Largest ORF (option)\n",
    "\n",
    "In any ORF, there may be multiple start codons present.  For the default assignment, only consider the largest gene in an ORF. For the extra-credit assignment, if this (largest ORF) option is not set, report all ORFs found (subject to the minimum size option).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Start codon(s) (option)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the default part of the program, only consider ATG as a start codon. For extra credit, use an input parameter that specifies a set of start codons.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stop codon(s) (option)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the default part of the program, only consider TAG, TAA and TGA as stop codons. For extra credit,  use an input parameter that specifies the set of stop codons.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Report output\n",
    "\n",
    "All positions reported use the coordinate position of the top strand, and the first position in the sequence (on the left) is position 1.  This coordinate system is used for all 6 coding frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "Frames 1 through 3 can be determined using the start position of the gene.  Assuming the position is p, (p mod 3) + 1 will provide the coding frame.  For genes on the bottom strand, the frame is based on the right hand side of the sequence (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "For each putative gene, your report must provide:\n",
    "\n",
    " - coding frame. for the top strand, a gene starting in the first position in the sequence is in frame 1.  For the bottom strand, frames are numbered based on the right-hand coordinate position of the sequence.  So, if the sequence is 100 bases long, and you have a gene in positions 89..100, that gene is in frame -1. You can still use the coordinate positions, but the calculation is:  - ( (len(sequence) - last position) mod 3 + 1).  Remember that the last position in this case corresponds to the start codon of the gene on the bottom strand.  These conventions make sense if you think about the reverse complement of the original sequence. The coding frame should be reported with a + or - as needed to describe the coding frame\n",
    " - start position. This position should correspond to the first base of the start codon (top strand) or last base of the stop codon (bottom strand), or the terminus of the genome if this is a gene fragment.\n",

    "# Hints:\n",
    "## One strand at a time\n",
    "\n",
    "One design solution considers only the top strand to generate gene candidates. We then generate the reverse complement and a second list of gene candidates.  When done in this way, remember to fix the start/end coordinates that you get from the reverse complement solution, since those will be based on the other end of the sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative design exists for the reverse strand that does not require generation of the reverse complement. This solution is interesting and may be simpler to consider. This solution scans the bottom strand left to right, finding stop codons first (reverse complement), then looking for start codons (reverse complement).\n",
    "\n",
    "A third solution for the bottom strand would scan right to left, finding starts until a stop is encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Start and Stop handling\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are going to do the extra-credit, then you will need to remember where the starts are until you find a stop.  This is straightforward if you place those start positions in a list, organized by frame. Even if you are not doing the extra-credit, placing starts on a list organized by frame will really simplify your code. This solution would require three lists for each of the three reading frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an alternative, you could scan each of the three reading frames seperately, counting by threes in each case. This seems to be the most straightforward way to do this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you do find a stop, you then consider the start(s) that you found along the way in this ORF.  Notice that the \"longest\" ORF is then defined by the start that is at the beginning of your start list.  Don't forget to clean up this list after you find genes using this stop since it would terminate all of those \"pending\" genes. What would happen if you didn't clean up your start list - you would be finding ORF candidates that had a stop in the middle of them, which means they are not __OPEN__ reading frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Termini and gene fragments\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a bit easier if you think that position 0(1 externally) will allways be a start position for a gene in every frame. This is the case where a start codon exists somewhere upstream of our sequence. It would code for a gene that would terminate in our sequence somewhere. This is the classic example of a dangling-stop. We would report this gene fragment beginning at position 0(1) and ending at the end of that in-frame stop. In frame 1, there might actually be a start codon at this position so dont count it twice. In Frames 2 or 3, there are extra bases ahead of our first full codon, so we will always have the possibility that the actual start is upstream of this dna fragment, so.. we report this as a dangling stop case starting at position 0(1).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Dangling starts always end at the end of sequence, even if that position is out of frame. In cases where no start or stop codon is found anywhere in the frame, the entire sequence is then considered as a gene.\n",
    "\n",
